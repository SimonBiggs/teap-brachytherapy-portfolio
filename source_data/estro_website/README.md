 > Since release of v.4.1 of the Oncentra Brachy TPS, there have been two different TG-43 dosimetry datasets to choose from for the model mHDR-v2 Ir-192 brachytherapy source. This issue arose due to the publication by Granero et al. (2011), which updated the dose analysis by Daskalov et al (1998) for the same source. Subsequently, the AAPM and ESTRO have issued consensus guidelines and TG-43 dosimetry datasets (Perez-Calatayud et al, 2012). In an effort to promote compliance with these guidelines and unify clinical practice, only the consensus TG-43 dosimetry datasets will be utilized in subsequent versions of Oncentra Brachy, released after 2014."
